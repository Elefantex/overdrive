"""What the catalog importers share about editions: telling one game from another, and writing the
other platform's edition of a game the catalog has.

The catalog has two blocks (app/state/catalog.js): "games" is the library the app lists, "twins"
holds the other editions of a work. Entries of one work share a "work" number, and the app shows
them as one game with its editions, so the PS5 edition of a PS4 game is a twin, never a second game.
